# Trux (T-Rux)

> React Hooks State Mangement System

## Usage

### 1. Create Storage (States, Actions)

    > my store folder at [here](./src/Store)
    >
    > Before anything, you should create to file, first state [or any name] (that contain you states and data objects),
    > then Actions [or any name] (this save your any action and method, you want to change state objects),

### 2. Provider Creation

    > this process should be in root component, alike `index.js` or `App.js` or any file you want to be
    then you importing `createTrux()` hook, then Send imported Object from Store Folder (state, actions) to them,

this state manager is lighter Redux, easier than Redux, and eating Redux as time ðŸ˜„

actually why we need to use redux and learn that system and structur when we can use easier way to statemangement, when it is not to hard to learn
